This directory contains the programmer's manual. The source is
in the .tex files; file manual.ps contains a postscript version of
the manual. You should be able to print out manual.ps; i.e., type

lpr manual.ps

The manual is about 75 pages long.

If this doesn't work, you can try to run the source document through
LaTex. To do this, type

make
rm manual.dvi
make

You have to run make twice to clean up forward label references.
This will result in a file named manual.dvi, which you can print
using your local print command.

If all else fails, send mail to xkernel-bugs@cs.arizona.edu and
we'll mail you a hard copy of the manual.
