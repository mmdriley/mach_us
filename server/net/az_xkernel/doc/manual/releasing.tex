\section{Releasing a Protocol}

Once you have debugged and tuned a new protocol, you can make it
available for others to use by creating a new directory in {\sanss
/usr/xkernel/protocols}, copying your source files into that
directory, creating a makefile in that directory, and modifying the
makefile in {\sanss /usr/xkernel/protocols}.  If your protocol is a
device driver, put the source files in {\sanss
/usr/xkernel/PLATFORM/drivers} instead of {\sanss
/usr/xkernel/protocols}.

If you want to make your new protocol available to other sites, then
make a tar file of your protocol available and drop a note to {\sanss
xkernel-bugs@cs.arizona.edu}.  We will include your protocol in the
next release. You should also create a ``man page'' for you protocol
similar to those found in Appendix A. The source files for these
man pages are in {\sanss /usr/xkernel/doc/manual/protocols}.
