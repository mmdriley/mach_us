\subsection*{NAME}

\noindent RRX (transfer Mach receive right).


\subsection*{SYNOPSIS}

SRX is a receive-right transfer protocol.  Transferring a receive
right involves coordination among the original holder of the receive
right, the new holder of the receive right, and all of the holders of
send rights to the port.

\noindent
\subsection*{EXTERNAL INTERFACE}

RRX uses subroutine calls to accept transfer requests, and to keep
{\em MachNetIPC} apprised of the movement of receive rights.

\subsection*{CONFIGURATION}

RRX depends on a synchronous lower protocol and BIDCTL to detect
reboots.
