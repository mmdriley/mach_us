\subsection*{NAME}

\noindent Sun Portmapper

\subsection*{SPECIFICATION}

\noindent  {\it ?}
Sun Microsystems, Inc., Mountain View, Calif., May 1988.

\subsection*{SYNOPSIS}

\noindent The portmapper supports four of the five of the
procedures defined by Sun.  Indirect Call, Function 5, is
not implemented.  This implementation is compatible with
Sun's native implementation.  The $x$-kernel portmapper is
treated as a separate protocol that sits on top of the
$x$-kernel implementation of Sun RPC.  This implementation
only supports UDP as a lower level protocol.  Client and
server protocols running above the sunrpc protocol make
remote procedures calls to the portmapper, using its
well-known UDP port number 111.

Our implementation of the Sun Portmapper protocol uses some
of the original SUN\_RPC include files.  You must have access
to Sun include files to compile this protocol.

\subsection*{REALM}

The portmapper is in the ASYNC realm.

\subsection*{CONFIGURATION}

The portmapper is a realm boundary protocol which assumes its single
lower protocol is in the RPC realm.
