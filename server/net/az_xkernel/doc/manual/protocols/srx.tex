\subsection*{NAME}

\noindent SRX (transfer Mach send right).


\subsection*{SYNOPSIS}

SRX is a send-right transfer protocol, used to transfer a Mach send
right when there are more than two parties involved (i.e., when the
original holder of the send right, the new holder of the send right,
and the holder of the receive right are on different hosts.)


\noindent
\subsection*{EXTERNAL INTERFACE}

SRX uses subroutine calls to accept transfer requests, and to notify 
{\em MachNetIPC} of the arrival of new rights.

\subsection*{CONFIGURATION}

SRX depends on a synchronous lower protocol and BIDCTL to detect
reboots.
