\subsection*{NAME}

\noindent VMUX ( Virtual Muliplexing Protocol )

\subsection*{SPECIFICATION}

VMUX sits above several lower protocols, making them appear as a
single protocol.  VMUX makes very simple decisions about which
protocol to use for each connection.

\subsection*{SYNOPSIS}

VMUX is only active during connection establishment.  When
openenabled, VMUX openenables all of its lower protocols on behalf of
the upper protocol.  When opened, VMUX attempts opens its lower
protocols in the order in which they were specified in the down vector
until a successful open occurs.  The successfully opened lower session
is then returned.

\subsection*{REALM}

Since VMUX is active only during open, it should be considered in the
same realm as the protocols below it (which should probably all be in
the same realm.)

\subsection*{PARTICIPANTS}

VMUX passes its participants to the lower protocols unmodified.

\subsection*{CONTROL OPERATIONS}

VMUX forwards control operations to the last protocol in the down
vector list.

\subsection*{CONFIGURATION}

The lower protocols will be opened in the order in which they are
listed in the configuration entry.
