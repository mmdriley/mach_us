This report describes how to implement protocols in the $x$-kernel.
It gives the $x$-kernel's programming interface, describes how to
configure an $x$-kernel that contains a certain collection of
protocols, and demonstrates how to run and debug an $x$-kernel.  The
$x$-kernel can be run in one of two environments: as a user program on
a Sun SparcStation running SunOS4.1, or as a task on a Mach3.0 system
(some platforms).  Protocols can be moved between the two environments
without modification.  This document assumes that the reader is
already familiar with the $x$-kernel's object-oriented infrastructure
for implementing protocols.
