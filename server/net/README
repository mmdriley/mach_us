This "net_server" source area contains two directories:
"az_xkernel" and "cmu_build".

The "az_xkernel" area is a "pristine" copy of the "xkernel" from the
University of Arizona used by the net_server.   The stuff in that area should
never be edited!  When new "xkernel" releases are to be used, then that
directory should be totally replaced.  These files are not "checked-in" under
resource control.  The xkernel tar file was unpacked there.  None of the
"Makefile"s in this area are actually used.

The "cmu_build" area contains the CMU stuff this includes all "changed"
copies of xkernel software as well as our own software.  All "Makefile"s
used to build the net_server and xkernel reside in this area.  It's dirs
parallel an xkernel release in order to support said said "changed" files.

It is shaped as follows:
	"etc","util",... parallel the same places in "az_kernel".
		Make "VPATH"s into "az_xkernel" areas.  Changed copies
		of files from az_xkernel areas belong in these areas.
		New "parallel" directories  may be made if there is
		a need to change something from an az_xkernel area
		that has seen no changes so far (except "lib" stuff).

	lib/{mach3,pi,protocols} parallel the same places in "az_kernel" sans
		the "lib".  Make "VPATH"s into "az_xkernel" areas.
		These areas are built as separate libraries, and
		as more xkernel protocols are used, the associated
		Makefiles and directory structures will need to be
		expanded.  Again changed copies of az_xkernel files
		belong in these "parallel" areas, and new (sub)dirs
		may be created to accommodate said changed files.

	"user" is where non-az xkernel "protocols" go, hence most of the
	actual CMU source for the net_server resides here.

	"STD" is where the "standard" release of the software is actually
	compiled from.  It "VPATH"s to	the "user" area, and others.
